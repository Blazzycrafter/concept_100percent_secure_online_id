An example 
amazon could ask for the direct address, so you don't have to type the address anymore
(which of course must then only be retrieved locally so it is not allowed to upload it to an answer server)
plus amazon needs a certificate for this feature
(to make sure that we give our address to amazon and not to a scammy amerzun website)



here are some more examples


Pornhub...
don't need to know my name or my age....
pornhub only needs to know if I am an adult!


amazon does not need my passport picture
but maybe we should give my passport picture to the delivery boy
so he knows what the recipient looks like? (must be an opt in option)



Any other ideas?

please suggest them
