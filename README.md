Concept:  
Only test questions are allowed...  
like python if statements....  

**NOT ALLOWED:**

 * What is this person's name?
 * How old is this person?

**ALLOWED:**

 * Is the name James?
 * Is the person over 18 years old?
 
 The answers are short and direct....  
**TRUE**  
**FALSE**  

 _Is the name James?_ **TRUE**  
 _is the age over 18?_ **FALSE**
 
_If the user wants to, they can encrypt the data...._  
_**but depending on the amount of data, it will take a while**_

The user **MUST** agree to share more details _(like the direct address of the place of residence)_  


all requests use a **unique, randomized request ID**, so _(if the user wants to encrypt the data...)_ the response is stored on a public _(government-provided or generally trusted)_ server   
so that the data can be retrieved **once**  
after the **one-time** retrieval, **_the data set and the response are deleted_**  

furthermore, **only the answer** is stored on the server and _**not** the question itself_  

so you cannot get any information from a (yes, no) question  
but only in connection with the question  
which is known to both the **requester** and the **requestee**

**_the encryption is done with RSA key pairs..._**  

sometimes special answers are required for comfort reasons  

An example  
amazon could ask for the direct address, so you don't have to type the address anymore  
_**(which of course must then only be retrieved locally so it is not allowed to upload it to an answer server)**_  
plus amazon needs a **certificate** for this feature  
_(to make sure that we give our address to amazon and not to a scammy amerzun website)_



here are some more examples  


Pornhub...
**don't need to know my name or my age....**
pornhub only needs to know if I am an adult!


amazon does not need my passport picture  
but maybe we should give my passport picture to the delivery boy
so he knows what the recipient looks like? (must be an opt in option)



Any other ideas?

please suggest them
