#### Summary
The system proposed in the concept is designed to allow users to verify certain data without disclosing sensitive or personal information. It achieves this by allowing only yes/no questions to be asked and by requiring users to consent to the release of more detailed information. The use of unique, randomized request IDs helps to ensure that only the user who made the request can access the response, reducing the risk of data leaks. The system also stores only the answer and not the question on a public server, further protecting sensitive information.

#### Evaluation
Overall, I think the system has potential as a way to verify data securely without disclosing too much personal information. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made, such as:
- Ensuring that the request IDs are truly unique and securely generated
- Making sure that the system is user-friendly and easy to use
- Ensuring that users are clearly informed about what information they are consenting to release and the implications of their decisions.
